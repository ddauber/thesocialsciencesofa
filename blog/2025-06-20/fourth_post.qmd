## ✍️ Introduction

Welcome! This post is a demonstration of how a typical Quarto blog post might look.\
It includes headings, inline formatting, R code, a data visualisation, tables, and more.

Quarto allows you to write in markdown, embed live code, and include **beautiful, reproducible outputs** — all in one place.

Whether you're documenting your research, writing tutorials, or just keeping notes, it gives you the flexibility of code and prose combined.

## 📋 Lists

### Unordered list

-   Quarto supports markdown out of the box\
-   Code can be executed and rendered inline\
-   You can embed LaTeX, HTML, or call external files

### Ordered list

1.  Install R and RStudio\
2.  Install Quarto CLI\
3.  Start writing posts like this one

## 💬 A Quote for Good Measure

## 📊 R Code and Visualisation

Let’s explore a classic dataset in R: `mtcars`. Below is a simple scatter plot showing how miles per gallon (`mpg`) relates to car weight (`wt`).

```{r}
#| classes: slide-in

library(ggplot2)

mtcars |>
ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(color = "#0072B2", size = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "MPG vs Weight",
    x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
    y = "Miles per Gallon",
    caption = "Figure 1. Scatterplot of fuel efficiency vs car weight using the mtcars dataset."
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
