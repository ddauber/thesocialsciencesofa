New analytical methods emerge monthly, data sets grow larger and more complex, and the pressure to produce reproducible, transparent research has never been higher.\nYet many of us are still using the same tools we learned in graduate school, clicking through the same menu systems, and wondering why our research feels… limited.\nDon’t get me wrong. There’s nothing inherently wrong with traditional statistical software. SPSS, and its cousins have served researchers well for decades. But here’s the thing: they’re like driving a reliable family saloon when you could be piloting a sports car."

Learning a programming language feels like learning Ancient Greek when you just want to analyse your survey data.

You don’t need to understand internal combustion engines to get from point A to point B. Similarly, you don’t need to become the next coding wizard to dramatically improve your research capabilities."

    "text": "The Hidden Benefits Nobody Mentions\nIn short, there are 5 main benefits (and probably some more that just won’t come to my mind right now), that could make you a more productive, and maybe even better, researcher.\n\n1. Your Analytical Toolbox Becomes Infinite\nTraditional software is like shopping at a small corner shop – you get the basics, but selection is often limited. Programming languages like R are like having access to the world’s largest free supermarket.\nNeed to run a cutting-edge machine learning algorithm published last week? There’s probably an R package for that. Want to try a new visualisation technique you saw in Nature? Someone’s likely coded it up and shared it freely.\nThe R ecosystem contains over 38,000 packages on CRAN alone (at the time of writing this blog), covering everything from social network analysis to text mining to geospatial statistics. It’s like having thousands of statistical consultants working for you, for free, 24/7.\n\noptions(repos = c(CRAN = \"https://cran.r-project.org\"))\n\nlength(available.packages())\n\n[1] 380664\n\n\nLet me share a story from when I was still beginning to learn R:\nI once attended a brilliant guest talk where the researchers had downloaded and coded over 200 tweets for a content analysis study. It was meticulous, careful work and the findings were genuinely impressive. However, when I asked how they scraped and cleaned the Twitter (now X) data, their response was: “Oh, we just did it manually.”\nI was stunned. That must have taken weeks. At the time, I had just learned how to pull down over half a million tweets for a separate project with a few lines of code.\nI wasn’t smarter. I just had a better toolbox. Programming didn’t just save me time, but it let me focus on the fun part: analysing the data and making sense of it.\n\n\n2. It Rewires Your Brain (In a Good Way)\nHere’s something they don’t teach in methodology courses: programming fundamentally changes how you think about problems.\nProgramming languages are ruthlessly logical. Write unclear code, and your computer will politely refuse to cooperate. This forces you to break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces, which is a skill that transfers beautifully to research design.\nI’ve noticed this with my own students. Those who learn programming often become better at:\n\nConceptual thinking: Breaking complex theories into testable components\nAbstract reasoning: Moving from specific observations to general principles\nProblem decomposition: Tackling large research questions systematically\n\nIt’s like cross-training for your brain. You come for the data analysis, but you leave with enhanced cognitive abilities.\n\n\n3. You See Patterns Others Miss\nWhen you’re not limited by pre-built menu options, you start exploring your data differently. You ask questions that wouldn’t occur to you in traditional software because the tools to answer them are suddenly available.\nFor example, one of my former PhD students was cleaning their survey data in R and inpsected missing data using the handy naniar package. This package is specialised in exploring patterns of missing data visually and computationally with often just one line of code. By plotting missing data and sorting all observations based on their missing data, my PhD student found that significant jumps in missing data coincided with page breaks in the survey, i.e. every time a participant was asked to continue to the next page, some participants simply stopped completing the questionnaire.\n\n\n\nTraditional software would never have prompted them to look at this, because data cleaning often happens outside the analytical software and most of the time not visually. However, with programming tools and R packages that visualise patterns quickly and easily, it became a natural extension of the analysis. Those response patterns ended up affecting how my student treated missing data and ended up with a much more robust analysis because of it.\n\n\n4. Your Research Becomes Bulletproof\nReproducibility crisis, anyone? When your entire analysis exists as code, reproducing your results becomes trivial. No more “I think I clicked this menu option, but I can’t remember which settings I used.”\nEvery step of your analysis is documented, shareable, and verifiable. Your future self (and your collaborators) will thank you when you need to revisit the analysis six months later. However, do not think that only applies to R programming. Back in the days I created SPSS scripts to keep track of everything and rerun analysis with updated datasets as necessary. This was a huge help and if you enjoy working with SPSS you should definitely look into this (if you haven’t already).\n\n\n5. The Compound Interest Effect\nHere’s the kicker: once you learn one programming language, learning others becomes exponentially easier. The core concepts like variables, functions, loops, data structures, etc., are universal.\nIf you asked me, maybe start with R for statistics, then maybe Python for machine learning, JavaScript for web-based visualisations, or SQL for database management. Each new language builds on the foundation of the previous ones and you can do even more things.\nIt’s like learning Roman languages. Once you understand Latin roots, Italian, Spanish, and French become much more accessible."

    "section": "But What About the Learning Curve?",
    "text": "But What About the Learning Curve?\nLet’s address the elephant in the room: learning programming takes time and effort. There’s no sugar-coating this.\nBut here’s the perspective shift that helped me: you’re not learning programming for programming’s sake. You’re learning it to become a better researcher.. Having skills others might not have also gives you the opportunity to work on more projects where your programming expertise is highly valued - even beyond your own discipline.\nEvery hour you invest in learning R is an hour that will pay dividends across every future project. It’s not overhead. It’s infrastructure.\nAnd honestly? The learning curve isn’t as steep as you think, not the least because there are so many learning materials and communities out there. You don’t need to master every aspect of a programming language to benefit from it. Learning enough R to clean data, run basic analyses, and create visualisations might take a few focused weeks. Learning enough to revolutionise your research might take a few months. After a year of using programming languages for your research you might never look back and only wonder: What else can I do now?\nCompare that to the time you’d spend manually manipulating data in spreadsheets over the course of your career, and the investment becomes a no-brainer. It was for me."

Choose Your First Language Wisely For social science researchers, R is typically the best starting point. It’s designed for statistics, has a huge and wonderfully inclusive community, and excels at the tasks you’ll do most often.\n2. Embrace the Beginner’s Mindset You will feel stupid at first. Your code will break. You’ll spend hours debugging what turns out to be a missing comma. This is normal and temporary. And hey, have you heard of ChatGPT? It can help with debugging your code.\n3. Start Small, Think Big Begin with simple tasks you already do. Import a dataset. Calculate some descriptive statistics. Create a basic plot. Build confidence before attempting anything fancy.\n4. Join the Community The R community is remarkably welcoming. Follow #RStats on X, join R User Groups like RStudio Community, TidyTuesday and R-Ladies, and participate in other online forums dedicated to R. Programming isn’t a solitary activity – it’s deeply social.\n5. Focus on Your Research Don’t get caught up in becoming a “real programmer”. Learn what you need to advance your research, then learn more when you need it. One day you look back at all the projects you completed using programming languages and find that you actually have become a “real programmer” - whatever that means to you."

    "section": "Step 1: The Innocent Beginning",
    "text": "Step 1: The Innocent Beginning\nLet’s start with what seems like a straightforward task: create a table showing the count of married, separated, and divorced people by gender across countries.\nFirst, we need to count the combinations of our three variables:\n\n# Create our base data\ntable_data &lt;- wvs_nona %&gt;%\n  count(gender, country, relationship_status) %&gt;%\n  filter(relationship_status %in% c(\"married\", \"separated\", \"divorced\"))\n\n# Take a peek\nhead(table_data)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  gender country relationship_status     n\n  &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;               &lt;int&gt;\n1 female Bolivia married               383\n2 female Bolivia separated              62\n3 female Bolivia divorced               27\n4 female Iran    married               448\n5 female Iran    separated               4\n6 female Iran    divorced               24\n\n\nThe count() function is doing the heavy lifting here. It groups by the three variables we specify and counts how many observations fall into each combination. The filter() step narrows our focus to just three relationship statuses – we’re keeping the analysis manageable.\nThis gives us a “long” format dataset where each row represents one combination of country, gender, and relationship status, with the count in the n column.\nNow we need to reshape this data to make it suitable for a table. We want countries as rows and the gender-relationship combinations as columns:\n\n# Reshape for table format\nwide_data &lt;- table_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(id_cols = country,\n              names_from = c(gender, relationship_status),\n              values_from = n)\n\nhead(wide_data)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  country female_married female_separated female_divorced male_married\n  &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;int&gt;            &lt;int&gt;           &lt;int&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n1 Bolivia            383               62              27          376\n2 Iran               448                4              24          518\n3 Iraq               442                6              10          423\n4 Japan              525                4              49          464\n5 Korea              491                1               1          407\n6 Egypt              399               10              23          434\n# ℹ 2 more variables: male_separated &lt;int&gt;, male_divorced &lt;int&gt;\n\n\npivot_wider() is the magic function here. Let’s break down what each argument does:\n\nid_cols = country: This tells R that country should remain as a column (our row identifier)\nnames_from = c(gender, relationship_status): These two variables will become column names\nvalues_from = n: The values that fill the table come from the n column (our counts)\n\nThe result is columns with names like female_married, male_divorced, etc. R automatically combines the values from gender and relationship_status with an underscore.\nNow let’s create our first GT table:\n\n# Our first attempt\nbasic_table &lt;- wide_data %&gt;%\n  gt() %&gt;%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"World Value Survey (WVS)\",\n    subtitle = \"Relationship Status by Gender and Country\"\n  )\n\nbasic_table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld Value Survey (WVS)\n\n\nRelationship Status by Gender and Country\n\n\ncountry\nfemale_married\nfemale_separated\nfemale_divorced\nmale_married\nmale_separated\nmale_divorced\n\n\n\n\nBolivia\n383\n62\n27\n376\n34\n24\n\n\nIran\n448\n4\n24\n518\n8\n6\n\n\nIraq\n442\n6\n10\n423\n5\n9\n\n\nJapan\n525\n4\n49\n464\n1\n20\n\n\nKorea\n491\n1\n1\n407\nNA\n7\n\n\nEgypt\n399\n10\n23\n434\n7\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gt() function creates the basic table object, and tab_header() adds a title and subtitle.

The part before the underscore becomes the group header (“female”, “male”), and the part after becomes the column label (“married”, “separated”, “divorced”).\nIt’s clean, it’s automatic, and it… doesn’t let you customise the subcategory labels. You’re stuck with “married”, “separated”, “divorced” exactly as they appear in your column names.\nWhat if you want “Married” (capitalised), “Sep.” (abbreviated), or “Divorced/Separated” (combined)? What if you want to style them with bold or italic text? tab_spanner_delim() just shrugs and says “take it or leave it.”"

The md() function allows us to use markdown formatting – in this case, italics with the asterisks.\nThe starts_with() function is a “tidy select” helper that selects columns based on their names. It’s much more reliable than typing out column names manually, especially when your column names follow a pattern.\nStep 2: Overarching Spanner\n\ntab_spanner(\n  label = md(\"**Gender**\"),\n  columns = starts_with(c(\"female_\", \"male_\")),\n  id = \"gender\"\n)\n\nThis creates a higher-level spanner that encompasses both gender groups. The columns argument uses a vector of prefixes to select all columns that start with either “female_” or “male_”. The id = \"gender\" gives this spanner a unique identifier that we could reference later if needed.\nStep 3: Column Label Customisation\n\ncols_label(\n  country = md(\"**Country**\"),\n  ends_with(\"married\") ~ \"Married\",\n  ends_with(\"separated\") ~ \"Separated\", \n  ends_with(\"divorced\") ~ \"Divorced\"\n)\n\nHere’s where the magic happens. cols_label() lets us rename columns, but it also supports conditional renaming using the ~ formula syntax.\n\ncountry = md(\"**Country**\"): Directly renames the country column\nends_with(\"married\") ~ \"Married\": This says “for any column that ends with ‘married’, rename it to ‘Married’”\n\nThis pattern-based renaming is incredibly powerful. Instead of writing:\n\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\nfemale_married = \"Married\",\nmale_married = \"Married\",\nfemale_separated = \"Separated\",\nmale_separated = \"Separated\"\n# ... and so on\n\n\n\nWe can use the formula syntax to apply the same transformation to multiple columns at once. The results is pretty respectable."

That’s because rowSums() doesn’t handle NA values the way you might expect – if any value in a row is NA, the entire sum becomes NA.\nIn our case, NA in the count data doesn’t mean “missing information” – it means “zero observations for this combination.” For example, if a country has no divorced males in the survey, that cell will be NA, but for our table purposes, we want to treat it as zero."

The gtExtras package includes several pre-built themes that can dramatically change your table’s appearance with a single line of code. This is particularly helpful if you want to quickly apply a uniform style to all your tables in a presentation, report or publication."

Sometimes reshaping is necessary.\nNA handling is context-dependent: In count data, NA often means zero, but in other contexts, it might mean something else entirely. Therefore, we might have to amend our table values as necessary.\nPattern-based selection is powerful: Functions like starts_with(), ends_with(), and where() make your code more robust, concise and less prone to errors.\nThe ~ formula syntax: This R feature appears in many places (cols_label(), across(), ggplot2) and is worth understanding deeply.\nLayered approach: gt’s philosophy of building tables layer by layer makes complex tables a lot more manageable.\n\nThe GT package is incredibly powerful, but like any sophisticated tool, it rewards understanding its patterns and conventions. When your table needs go beyond the basics, don’t be afraid to break down the problem into smaller steps and build up your solution incrementally."

It lives in your home directory and is invisible by default (hence the mysterious dot).\nIn RStudio, run this command to open your .Rprofile:\n\nusethis::edit_r_profile()\n\n\n\nStep 2: Add Your First customisation\nCopy and paste this magical incantation into your .Rprofile:\n\n# The secret sauce for RStudio customisation\nsetHook(\"rstudio.sessionInit\", function(newSession) {\n  \n  # Clear the console for a fresh start\n  cat(\"\\014\")\n  \n  # Your first personalised message\n  message(\"Welcome back, data wizard! ✨\")\n  message(\"Today's forecast: 100% chance of insights!\")\n  },\n  action = \"append\")\n\n\n\nStep 3: Restart and Marvel\nSave the file, restart RStudio, and watch the magic happen. You have just taken your first step into a larger world of customisation possibilities. If all you want is a custom message, this does the trick. If you want something more intriguing and exciting, then read on.\nThe Technical Bit: Everything that follows in this post should go between those curly braces where you see the messages. The setHook(\"rstudio.sessionInit\", ...) {...} wrapper is the key that makes everything work in RStudio. It is like telling RStudio “hey, run this code every time you start up.” I will show you the inner code for clarity, but remember to wrap it in the setHook() structure. In short: You always start from this template:\n\nsetHook(\"rstudio.sessionInit\", function(newSession) {\n  \n  # Put your custom .Rprofile code chunk here\n  # to customise your startup experience of RStudio.\n\n    },\n  action = \"append\")"

The setHook() function is your secret weapon for RStudio customisation. It is like having a backstage pass to RStudio’s startup sequence.\nThe beauty of this approach is that it is completely non-destructive.

For those brave enough to venture into the realm of epic ASCII art, here is something that will make your colleagues either deeply impressed or deeply concerned about your priorities.\n\ncat(\"\\014\")\n\n# ASCII art Star Wars inspired message\nmessage_art &lt;- \"\n __\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n|__|\n\n     ___      .___  ___.\n    /   \\\\     |   \\\\/   |\n   /  ^  \\\\    |  \\\\  /  |\n  /  /_\\\\  \\\\   |  |\\\\/|  |\n /  _____  \\\\  |  |  |  |\n/__/     \\\\__\\\\ |__|  |__|\n\n____    ____  ______    __    __  .______\n\\\\   \\\\  /   / /  __  \\\\  |  |  |  | |   _  \\\\\n \\\\   \\\\/   / |  |  |  | |  |  |  | |  |_)  |\n  \\\\_    _/  |  |  |  | |  |  |  | |      /\n    |  |    |  `--'  | |  `--'  | |  |\\\\  \\\\----.\n    |__|     \\\\______/   \\\\______/  | _| `._____|\n\n.___________. _______     ___       ______  __    __   _______ .______\n|           ||   ____|   /   \\\\     /      ||  |  |  | |   ____||   _  \\\\\n`---|  |----`|  |__     /  ^  \\\\   |  ,----'|  |__|  | |  |__   |  |_)  |\n    |  |     |   __|   /  /_\\\\  \\\\  |  |     |   __   | |   __|  |      /\n    |  |     |  |____ /  _____  \\\\ |  `----.|  |  |  | |  |____ |  |\\\\  \\\\----.\n    |__|     |_______/__/     \\\\__\\\\ \\\\______||__|  |__| |_______|| _| `._____|\n\"\n\ncat(message_art)\nmessage(\"\\n\\n   Welcome to the dark side! \\n\\n\")\n\n\n\n\nI created this using ASCII Art Generator, which is an absolutely fantastic rabbit hole to fall down when you should be working."

The R.version.string gives you your R version, R.version$platform tells you what system you are running on, and basename(getwd()) shows just the name of your current working directory without the full path (because nobody needs to see /Users/YourName/Documents/Projects/That_Analysis_You_Started_Six_Months_Ago_But_Never_Finished).\nThe sum(grepl(\"^package:\", search())) is a neat little trick to count attached packages. The search() function lists all kinds of objects, including loaded packages. Therefore, we have to make sure we only count objects that relate to loaded packages. The grepl() function is an important one to remember if you work with character vectors frequently. It allows us to look for patterns in text, in our case this is package:. Learning how to use grepl() is certainly an essential skill everyone should tackle at some point in their R journey.\nHere is an example of the unfiltered search() output:\n\nsearch()\n\n[1] \".GlobalEnv\"        \"package:stats\"     \"package:graphics\" \n[4] \"package:grDevices\" \"package:utils\"     \"package:datasets\" \n[7] \"package:methods\"   \"Autoloads\"         \"package:base\""

We check for package availability using requireNamespace() with quietly = TRUE to avoid annoying error messages. The identity function is our safety net. It is like having a backup plan that just returns whatever you give it, effectively removing color formatting when crayon is not available.\nThis is the kind of defensive programming that separates the experienced programmers from novices. Your .Rprofile should enhance your experience, not break it when a package goes missing."

But what if we could break free from the confines of our computer and connect with the wider world? What if your startup screen could tell you whether you will need an umbrella for your lunch break or not?\nWelcome to the world of dynamic content. Here is how to turn your R startup into a personal weather station:\n\ncat(\"\\014\")\n\n# Attempt to fetch and display weather information\ntryCatch({\n  \n  # Check for required packages\n  required &lt;- c(\"httr\")\n  \n  for (pkg in required) {\n    if (!requireNamespace(pkg, quietly = TRUE)) {\n      message(\"❗ Package '\", pkg, \"' is not installed.

The service will automatically detect your location based on your IP address, or you can specify a city by changing “London” to your preferred location.\nThe GET() function from the httr packages makes the HTTP request, and we set a timeout to prevent your startup from hanging if the weather service is having a bad day. The tryCatch() wrapper is our safety net as it ensures that if something goes wrong with the weather fetch, your RStudio startup will not crash and burn.\nNotice how we are building in resilience here. The internet is a fickle beast, and APIs can fail. Good startup customisation code should degrade gracefully when things go wrong."

Every paradise has its serpents, and startup customisation is no exception.\nThe Network Dependency Dilemma: All those beautiful dynamic features only work when you are connected to the internet. Work from a coffee shop with spotty WiFi? You might stare at error messages instead of inspiring quotes. The solution? Always include fallback content for offline scenarios.\nThe Speed Trap: Fetching external data adds latency to your startup. While we are talking seconds, not minutes, some users prefer their R sessions to start faster than you can say “statistical significance”. Consider your personal patience levels when adding network-dependent features.\nThe API Reliability Roulette: Third-party services can go down, change their APIs, or start requiring authentication. Always wrap your API calls in error handling, and do not let a broken quote service break your entire R startup experience.\nThe Rate Limit Reality: Some APIs have rate limits. If you are the type who starts R sessions every five minutes while debugging, you might hit these limits. Choose your APIs wisely, and do not abuse the free tiers."

Working on a machine learning project? Get a reminder of your model’s latest performance. Analyzing survey data? See a quick summary of your response rates.\nThe Package Sentinel: Create a system that checks for outdated packages and gently reminds you to update them. No more surprises when that function you have been using for months suddenly breaks because of a breaking change in a dependency.\nThe Git Whisperer: If you are working with version control, display the current branch and repository status. Are you on main when you should be on develop? Your startup screen can save you from committing to the wrong branch.\nThe Calendar Oracle: Connect to your calendar API and display upcoming meetings or deadlines. Nothing says “professional data scientist” like having your startup screen remind you about that 2 pm stakeholder meeting.\nThe Motivation Engine: Create a rotating set of personal motivational messages tailored to your current challenges. Working on a particularly difficult analysis? Let your startup screen be your cheerleader.\nYou might also explore the cowsay package for ASCII animals that can deliver your messages (because everything is better when a cow says it), or investigate APIs that require authentication for more personalised data."

What it will do is make your daily R experience more personal, more delightful, and more uniquely yours.\nIn a world where we spend countless hours staring at screens, fighting with data, and debugging code, these small moments of joy matter. They are the difference between viewing your tools as cold, impersonal utilities and seeing them as extensions of your personality and creativity.\nThe key is finding the right balance for your workflow. Some days you will want the full ASCII art, weather report, and inspirational quote experience. On other days, you will appreciate the simple elegance of a cleared console and a friendly greeting.\nYour .Rprofile is yours to customise.
