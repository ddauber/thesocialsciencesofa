This post is a demonstration of how a typical Quarto blog post might look.\\\nIt includes headings, inline formatting, R code, a data visualisation, tables, and more.\n\nQuarto allows you to write in markdown, embed live code, and include **beautiful, reproducible outputs** — all in one place.\n\nWhether you're documenting your research, writing tutorials, or just keeping notes, it gives you the flexibility of code and prose combined.\n\n## 📋 Lists\n\n### Unordered list\n\n-   Quarto supports markdown out of the box\\\n-   Code can be executed and rendered inline\\\n-   You can embed LaTeX, HTML, or call external files\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1.  Install R and RStudio\\\n2.  Install Quarto CLI\\\n3.  Start writing posts like this one\n\n## 💬 A Quote for Good Measure\n\n> “A picture is worth a thousand words. A good plot is worth even more in R.”\\\n> — You, after adopting Quarto\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n## 📊 R Code and Visualisation\n\nLet’s explore a classic dataset in R: `mtcars`. Below is a simple scatter plot showing how miles per gallon (`mpg`) relates to car weight (`wt`).\n\n\n::: {.cell .slide-in}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nmtcars |>\nggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#0072B2\", size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"MPG vs Weight\",\n    x = \"Weight (1000 lbs)\",\n    y = \"Miles per Gallon\",\n    caption = \"Figure 1. Scatterplot of fuel efficiency vs car weight using the mtcars dataset.\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](fourth_post_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.slide-in}\nThis should slide in from below!\n:::",
