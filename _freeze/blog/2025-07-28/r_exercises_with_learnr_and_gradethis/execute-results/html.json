Here's Why and How\"\ndescription: \"Creating hands-on, beginner-friendly R tutorials that make statistics and coding accessible through interactive exercises, knowledge checks, and real-world case studies using learnr and gradethis.\"\nauthor: \"Daniel Dauber\"\ndate: 2025-07-17\ncategories: [R, education, interactive tutorials, learnr, statistics]\ndraft: true\nimage: \"r4np_r_package_learnr_tutorials.jpg\"\n---\n\n\n::: slide-in\n<img src=\"r4np_r_package_learnr_tutorials.jpg\" alt=\"R for Non-Programmers interactive exercises\" width=\"100%\">\n:::\n\nHere is a little confession: When I started writing [R for Non-Programmers](https://r4np.com), my goal was simple: Demystify R for my students and colleagues who didn’t see themselves as coders. The feedback was incredible. But one thing became clear: hands-on, interactive practice is what really helps people learn and not just some words printed on a piece of paper (or digital screen).\n\nThat's exactly why I created 350+ exercises for my book [R for Non-Programmers](https://r4np.com). What started as a simple supplement for my students turned into a comprehensive learning system that's changing how my students learn R, statistics and quantitative methods.\n\n## Why I Created The `r4np` package\n\nLet me be honest: there's never enough time in a research methods class. You're juggling methodology, statistical concepts, coding syntax, and that inevitable \"Why does my code not work?\" moment – all while the clock ticks away your precious lecture time.\n\n::: slide-in\n<img src=\"01_r4np_package_website.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot of an example exercise in the r4np package which shows custom feedback based on the mistake a learner made.\" width=\"100%\">\n:::\n\nThe biggest challenge for students with no background in statistics or coding is understanding that a coding language is actually a *language* – not just a technical tool. The `tidyverse` is particularly suited to make R feel conversational rather than mechanical. But as is the case with every foreign language: Only practice makes perfect.\n\nMany of my students use the R4NP book to get a head start before class, rather than scrambling to keep up during lectures. But even with plenty of in-class practice, there's never enough time for those crucial extra exercises that cement understanding. That's where interactive, self-paced exercises become invaluable as the perfect companion for bridging classroom learning with independent practice.\n\n## What's Included: A Numbers Game\n\nThe `r4np` R package includes useful functions, datasets, and of course, the tutorials. One aspect I'm particularly proud of is the `ntest()` and `ntest_by()` functions, which effectively allow you to run normality tests in batches. Ever had that problem of having 20 groups and 5 variables to run group comparisons? Well, happy times – we don't have to run a 100 group comparisons manually anymore, but I still painfully remember those days when I had to do that, long before I learned R.\n\nThe tutorials are organised by chapter, making it easy to pick up where you left off. In total, I created:\n\n- **205 Knowledge Checks**: Quick quizzes to test understanding\n- **139 Coding Practices**: Hands-on R exercises with instant feedback\n- **14 Case Studies**: Real-world scenarios and applied challenges\n\nHere's how each type works:\n\n**Knowledge Checks** are focused questions that verify understanding before moving to coding. Think: \"Which of these is not a tidyverse package?\" or \"What does statistical significance mean?\" They reinforce the \"why\" and \"what\" before the \"how.\"\n\n**Coding Practices** are hands-on exercises that appear right after concepts are introduced. These turn ideas into code, building step-by-step from basic to advanced through active practice.\n\n**Case Studies** are comprehensive projects that integrate multiple concepts through realistic scenarios involving data cleaning, analysis, and interpretation. Students tackle open-ended problems and think like data analysts.\n\n::: slide-in\n<img src=\"02_r4np_example_exercise_triptych.jpg\" alt=\"Three images composed together which show the three different types of exercises.\" width=\"100%\">\n:::\n\n## Behind the Scenes: The Technical Magic\n\nThe `learnr` package powers all interactive activities, enabling both multiple choice questions and live coding exercises. But the real game-changer is `gradethis`, which transforms how we provide feedback on coding practices.\n\n::: slide-in\n<img src=\"03_r4np_example_exercise_feedback.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot of an example exercise in the r4np package which shows custom feedback based on the mistake a learner made.\" width=\"100%\">\n:::\n\nHere's the challenge: How do you automatically check if student code is correct when there are multiple ways to solve the same problem? Traditional approaches compare code character-by-character, but `gradethis` lets you check specific aspects of the solution instead.\n\nConsider this regression example:\n\n\n::: {.cell class='slide-in'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Solution code\nmodel1 <- lm(recovery_days ~ severity, data = patients_clean)\nsummary(model1)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell class='slide-in'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Custom grading function using the gradethis R package\ngrade_this({\n  code_text <- paste(deparse(.user_code), collapse = \" \")\n  if (!grepl(\"lm\\\\s*\\\\(\", code_text) ||\n      !grepl(\"recovery_days\\\\s*~\\\\s*severity\", code_text)) {\n    fail(\"Did you fit the model recovery_days ~ severity?\")\n  }\n  if (!grepl(\"summary\", code_text)) {\n    fail(\"Did you output the regression summary?\")\n  }\n  pass(\"Good! Model 1 includes only severity as a predictor.\")\n})\n```\n:::\n\n\nInstead of generic \"something is wrong\" messages, students get specific guidance: `Did you fit the model recovery_days ~ severity?` This targeted feedback is crucial for beginners who need direction, not just correction.\n\nThe trade-off? This approach easily doubled development time since I had to anticipate common mistakes and craft appropriate responses. But watching students debug their code with confidence instead of frustration made every extra hour worthwhile.\n\n## A Peek at the Content: Real-World Learning\n\nThe case studies are where everything comes together. These aren't \"run this code and see what happens\" exercises – they're realistic scenarios that mirror actual data analysis workflows.\n\n**[SCREENSHOT SUGGESTION: Multi-panel screenshot showing a complete case study journey - maybe the student satisfaction analysis with: 1) initial data inspection, 2) assumption testing with ntest(), 3) visualization creation, 4) results interpretation]**\n\nTake the student satisfaction analysis from the mixed methods chapter. Students don't just run a t-test and call it done. They:\n\n- Inspect the data for outliers and missing values\n- Test statistical assumptions using those handy `ntest()` functions\n- Create meaningful visualizations to understand the data\n- Interpret findings and discuss limitations\n- Consider the practical significance of their results\n\nThis mirrors real-world analysis: messy data, multiple decision points, and the need to communicate findings clearly. By the end, students have experienced the full analytical process, not just isolated statistical tests.\n\n## How to Access & Use: Getting Started\n\nThe book lives at [r4np.com](https://r4np.com), with the package documentation at [https://ddauber.github.io/r4np/](https://ddauber.github.io/r4np/) and source code at [https://github.com/ddauber/r4np](https://github.com/ddauber/r4np).\n\n**[SCREENSHOT SUGGESTION: Step-by-step visual guide showing: 1) installing the package, 2) running install_r4np(), 3) launching a tutorial, 4) the tutorial interface]**\n\nGetting started takes three simple steps (or maybe only one if you complete the first two already):\n\n```r\n# 1. Install the package\nremotes::install_github(\"ddauber/r4np\")\n\n# 2. Install all required dependencies\nr4np::install_r4np()\n\n# 3. Launch any chapter tutorial\nlearnr::run_tutorial(\"ex_r_basics\", package = \"r4np\")\n```\n\nThe exercises are self-contained and can be tackled in any order that matches your learning goals. Whether you're a complete beginner or strengthening your foundation, you can jump in wherever makes sense.\n\n## What's Next: More R Adventures Ahead\n\nA new book is already in the works, focusing on one of my favourite aspects of data analysis – but no spoilers yet!\n\nBased on our feedback, I'll continue refining these exercises and adding new content. There's always room for improvement, and I'm excited to see which areas resonate most with learners.\n\n---\n\n**Ready to dive in?** Head over to [r4np.com](https://r4np.com) and start your R journey with interactive exercises. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to strengthen your foundation, there's something here for everyone.\n\n*Happy coding!*",
